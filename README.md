## Visual improvements

- Theme: [Maple Light](https://github.com/subframe7536/vscode-theme-maple)

A colorful VS Code theme, support light or dark mode, with medium brightness and low saturation.

- Font: [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

JetBrains Monoâ€™s typeface forms are simple and free from unnecessary details. Rendered in small sizes, the text looks crisper. The easier the forms, the faster the eye perceives them and the less effort the brain needs to process them.
